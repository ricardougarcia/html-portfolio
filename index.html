        <p>
          Welcome to my portfolio page! My name is Ricardo Garcia, and I am
          excited to showcase a few of my projects and give insights to my
          colorful work experience. Just a quick glance at my work history will
          show you that my professional background is as diverse as the projects
          you see showcased on this page. For the past 7 years I have worked in
          educational technology and overtime have grown passionate about
          leveraging technology to improve lives; working elbow to elbow with
          schools across the nation to see just how techonlogy can bridge gaps
          in equity and be an invaluable pedagogical tool. This is the main
          reason I decided to become a software developer. My goal is to
          positively impact lives by helping to create and design solutions that
          make a measurable impact in the communities that I serve. Thanks for
          browsing around and feel free to ask for more!

            If individuals are able to quantify the time vs. money vs. CO2
            relationship of different methods of transit, then individuals will
            be able to make better informed decisions about what to prioritize
            for different trips. This application is the first step in
            accomplishing that initiave.
